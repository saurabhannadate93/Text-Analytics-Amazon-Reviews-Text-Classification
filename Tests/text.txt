For under $20 dollars I wasn't expecting too much. When I first started using the buds everything worked out fine, sound was a little muddy bass and mids are the focus for these buds. After a few days the earbuds would suddenly stop playing music, I would have to manual hit play on my phone which isn't a deal breaker but then the left bud would intermittently stop and start again, this is the reason I returned these buds. I must have gotten a bad set since there's so many positive reviews on these and I have owned several Blueido headphones without issues. I might get another set but I think I will do more research before buying my next set of wirless earbuds.
